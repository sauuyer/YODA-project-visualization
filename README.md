This R code processes metadata from Johnston & Johnson clinical trials provided by the Yale Open Data Access Project and visualize it in an igraph network in an attempt to get a sense for how clinical trial data is reused and what it is used for. These clinical trials are listed here: https://yoda.yale.edu/table-3-data-requests-approved
